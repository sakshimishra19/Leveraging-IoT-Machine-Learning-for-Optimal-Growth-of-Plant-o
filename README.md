# Leveraging-IoT-Machine-Learning-for-Optimal-Growth-of-Plant-o
The project aims to predict plant diseases early in green gram crops using IoT sensors and machine learning. Environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil moisture are analyzed using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The model is integrated with a Streamlit interface for real-time disease predictions using sensor data.
